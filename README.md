[holetune github io](https://holetune.github.io/). 

This project is heavily inspired/powered by [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and [Markmap](https://github.com/gera2ld/markmap).
- Execute `git pull` before you add new `.md` files, since the Github Action will overwrite the files (ie. index.html) in remote master branch. 
- Originally from [tiny mindmap](https://github.com/aibazhang/tiny-mindmap)
